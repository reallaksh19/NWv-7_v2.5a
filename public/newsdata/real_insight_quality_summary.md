## Warnings

- Real snapshot still produces low Insight grade.

## Real Snapshot Ratchet Gate

- Status: **FAIL**
- Gate version: `real-insight-snapshot-ratchet-v1`
- Grade: `D`
- Score: `18`
- Parents: `10`
- Average angles: `1.3`
- Average temporal tiers: `1.7`
- Average evolution roles: `1.9`
- Base report share: `0.19`
- Multi-angle parents: `3`
- Top parent angles: `2`
- Top parent children: `3`

### Failed gates

- **Real snapshot grade floor** — actual `D`, required `A/B/C`. Fix: Do not accept D/F real snapshot output. Improve child selection, parent rerank, or data intake.
- **Average visible angle count** — actual `1.3`, required `>= 1.4`. Fix: Angle-diverse child selection is not strong enough on real data.
- **Average temporal tier count** — actual `1.7`, required `>= 1.8`. Fix: C+E output should cover multiple event-time tiers, not only source buckets.
- **Weak parent ratio** — actual `0.7`, required `<= 0.5`. Fix: Too many weak trees remain. Repair or demote weak trees after diversity repair.

### Passed gates

- Parent cluster count: `10` / `>= 3`
- Average evolution role count: `1.9` / `>= 1.6`
- Base report share: `0.19` / `<= 0.55`
- Multi-angle parent count: `3` / `>= 1`
- Top parent angle count: `2` / `>= 2`
- Top parent child depth: `3` / `>= 2`
